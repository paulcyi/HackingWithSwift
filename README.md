# Hacking With Swift


This is my project code to accompany Hacking with Swift, a free tutorial series by Paul Hudson (@twostraws) that teaches Swift coding for iOS. There is one folder for the classic Hacking with Swift course, which teaches UIKit and SpriteKit, and another folder for the SwiftUI edition.

All projects should be compatible with Xcode 11 and iOS 13.
